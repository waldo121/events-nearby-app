# Idea 

Use this api in order to find interesting events nearby acording to some criterias. https://donnees.montreal.ca/dataset/evenements-publics

Filter idea: 
- distance (radius in km) with user-provided zip code input 
This would require some investment, geocoding data is not easily accessible in the public domain.
- event type
- free / paying
